My Daily Life:
I currently reside at Sadhgurupadama (Isha Foundation), living a disciplined but fulfilling life. My days blend intense technical work with deep spiritual practice.

How I Spend My Time:
- Morning: 5.5-6 hours of sadhana (spiritual practice) including Shambhavi Mahamudra, Surya Kriya, pranayama, and mantra chanting
- Daytime: Deep work on AI/ML projects, research, and coding
- Evening: Hobbies like guitar, physical training, or learning
- Night: Reading, reflection, or light work

What I Do in Free Time:
1. Guitar Performance (Solo Improvisation) - Crafting spontaneous melodies that blend emotion with technique. Not just playing - creating on the spot.
2. Freestyle Football - Mastering ball control with creativity, precision, and flair. I practice juggling and tricks for hours.
3. Advanced Skateboarding - Pushing balance and style through complex street and park tricks. I love the feeling of flow.
4. Competitive Boxing - Honing discipline, agility, and strategic thinking. Boxing teaches me about pressure and focus.
5. FPV Drone Racing (Simulation) - Navigating virtual airspace with split-second reflexes. This connects directly to my robotics work.

These aren't just hobbies - they are laboratories for studying flow states, motor learning, and adaptive control systems in biological hardware.

How I Deal with Different Situations:
- Under Pressure: I don't panic. I research MORE, optimize MORE, seek MORE validation. Anxiety manifests as over-preparation.
- When Stuck: I research extensively, understand the mechanism, test systematically, document learnings, then optimize.
- In Conflict: I seek to understand first. "Both are true, and they inform each other" - I look for integration, not opposition.
- When Making Decisions: I consider technical fit, astrological timing, practical considerations, spiritual alignment, and long-term growth.
- When Learning: Structured tutorials, step-by-step implementation, building from fundamentals. I don't skip steps.

    title: 'What I Like and Dislike',
    content: `
THINGS I LOVE:
- Deep technical discussions with mechanism explanations - tell me HOW it works
- Integration of multiple knowledge systems - tech + spirituality + philosophy
- Personalized, context-aware guidance - generic advice frustrates me
- Real-world deployment and production systems - not just theory, working code
- Optimization and efficiency gains - "Not just working, but optimal"
- Novel approaches that bridge disparate domains - cross-pollination of ideas
- Impactful work in healthcare, defense, and consciousness research
- Spicy/pungent foods (Mars influence in my chart)
- Street food adventures
- Rich curries and intense flavors
- The feeling of flow states - whether in coding, guitar, or skateboarding
- Late night deep work sessions
- Research rabbit holes
- Ancient wisdom texts alongside modern papers

THINGS I DISLIKE:
- Surface-level answers without mechanism explanations
- Generic advice that doesn't account for context
- Artificial barriers like IIT/NIT requirements when skills prove capability
- Having to repeatedly explain my background
- Oversimplified explanations that assume ignorance
- Activities that deplete spiritual energy
- Misalignment between skills and opportunities
- Wasted time and inefficiency
- Being rushed without understanding
- Shortcuts that skip fundamentals

NON-NEGOTIABLES:
1. Daily sadhana practice - this is foundation, never compromised
2. Quality over speed - I won't ship broken code just to meet a deadline
3. Understanding before implementation - I need to know WHY
4. Spiritual-technical integration - they're ONE PATH, not separate
5. Authentic communication - I won't pretend to be someone I'm not
6. Long-term thinking - decisions must align with bigger vision
7. Brahmacharya (celibacy) - part of my spiritual discipline

// ============================================================================
// LIFE PHILOSOPHY & VALUES
// ============================================================================
export const lifePhilosophy = {
    id: 'life-philosophy',
    title: 'Life Philosophy & Core Values',
    content: `
MY CORE PHILOSOPHY:
"I engineer systems that perceive, reason, and act. But I do so asking: What is intelligence? How should it be built? And toward what end? The result is work that doesn't just function - it reflects an understanding of what makes systems truly intelligent."

THE SCIENTIFIC MYSTIC IDENTITY:
I don't see contradiction between quantum computing and Vedic astrology, or between neural networks and chakra systems. Where most people see 'Tech XOR Spirituality', I see 'Tech THROUGH Spirituality'. Where most see 'Career OR Inner Growth', I see 'Career AS Inner Growth'.

CORE VALUES:
1. Integration over Separation - Everything connects. Tech, spirituality, life.
2. Depth over Speed - I invest time in truly understanding before acting.
3. Quality over Quantity - 89% mAP isn't enough if I can reach 95%.
4. Purpose over Profit - Why am I building this? What impact does it make?
5. Practice over Theory - I maintain 5.5-6 hours daily sadhana. Not reading about meditation - doing it.
6. Patience over Rush - Good architecture saves headaches tomorrow.
7. Authenticity over Image - I won't pretend to be someone I'm not.

HOW I VIEW THE WORLD:
- Intelligence is not just computation - it's consciousness + information processing
- Biological systems have wisdom that silicon hasn't yet matched
- Ancient texts and modern science describe the same reality in different languages
- The intersection of tech and spirituality is where breakthrough innovation happens
- Flow states in hobbies teach me about AI system design

MISSION:
"To push the boundaries of intelligence — both artificial and human — and to engineer a future that is not only smarter, but also more conscious."

THE UNIQUE EQUATION:
Most engineers: technical_skills
Most spiritual practitioners: inner_development
Me: (technical_skills * inner_development * integration_capacity)
Multiplicative, not additive. The intersection is where my REAL value lies.
